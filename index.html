                <h2> Tributes to George Floyd</h2>
                <P>By now the story of George Floyd has been heard and witnessed all over the world by millions of people. The tall man had gone to a store. He was said to have paid with with a fake 20 dollar bill. The palestinian owner called the police. George was handcuffed. He offered no resistance. He was made to lie prone on the tarmac, with his hand scuffed behind him. Police officer Derek Chauvin held him down, puting his knee and weight of his body on him, therby leading to his death.<a href="" target="_blank">Read more on Floyd</a> </P>
